# Infer_parallel

 This library tries to contain the core parallel, message-passing, and
 task bar components used in
 [Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer). It wraps them in a tidier
 interface, and builds with `dune`. It is a personal best effort and
 offered 'as-is': there is no guarantee for maintenance.

 This project was inspired by Rijnard van Tonder's
 [hack_parallel](https://github.com/rvantonder/hack_parallel).
